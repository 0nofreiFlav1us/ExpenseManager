As a student on a limited budget, I needed an efficient way to track my spending, so I developed an Expense Manager. The web application allows me to add, edit, and delete expenses, and it provides daily and monthly spending statistics. To simplify expense entry, I integrated the Google Cloud Vision APIâ€™s OCR feature, which enables receipt scanning and automatic text extraction, making it faster to log and organize my expenses.
